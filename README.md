# ðŸ”¥ FireStream API - Open Source S3 Alternative

## Overview
This is a secure, rate-limited file upload API built with Express.js and Prisma. It supports API key authentication, file uploads, and file management. Uploaded files are stored locally, and metadata is recorded in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features
- Secure authentication using API keys
- File upload support (single and multiple files)
- File size limit: 1GB (can be changed in the code)
- File management endpoints (list and delete files)
- Strict CORS policies
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Security Features
- **Helmet**: Enhances API security by setting HTTP headers.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits each IP to 100 requests per 15 minutes.
- **API Key Authentication**: Ensures only authorized users can access endpoints.

## Error Handling
Common errors include:
- `400`: Invalid request or file size exceeded
- `401`: Unauthorized (missing or invalid API key)
- `403`: Forbidden (not allowed to delete another userâ€™s file)
- `404`: File not found
- `500`: Internal server error

## Deployment
To deploy the API:
1. Set up a PostgreSQL database.
2. Deploy the application to a server.
3. Use a process manager like PM2:
   ```sh
   pm2 start npm --name "file-upload-api" -- start
   ```
4. Configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to forward requests to the application.
